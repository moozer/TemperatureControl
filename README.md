Schematic and other stuff related to pwm heating and pt100 temperature sensing

What is this?
--------------
A friend of mine is a micro brewer and he want to have some automation...

The idea is to make a board that can connect to an ordinary digital pwm output and through a relay give power to an electrical heater, and on the sensor side, a pt100 sensor can be attached.
